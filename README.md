# SuperPixiv
Makes using Pixiv more bearable


## Illust popup
By clicking on a picture in sections such as the Discovery tab or similar pictures, this will display
the illustration in a popup instead of changing page.

If you want to go to the actual page, you can click at the bottom of the pic or the title instead of the picture.

## Proxy images

Bandwidth from Pixiv servers to Europe has always been bad, but in the last year it started becoming
actually unusable. This script replaces all img URLs to use a proxy server with better ping instead.

Currently using: `https://i.pixiv.re`
