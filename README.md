# SuperPixiv
Makes using Pixiv more bearable


## Illust popup
By clicking on a picture in sections such as the Discovery tab or similar pictures, this will display
the illustration in a popup instead of changing page.

If you want to go to the actual page, you can click at the bottom of the pic or the title instead of the picture.
